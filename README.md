# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 

Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. 

## Data
You have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points. This dataset consists of various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc. which may or may not be useful in ultimately deciding whether a lead will be converted or not. The target variable, in this case, is the column ‘Converted’ which tells whether a past lead was converted or not wherein 1 means it was converted and 0 means it wasn’t converted. You can learn more about the dataset from the data dictionary provided in the zip folder at the end of the page. Another thing that you also need to check out are the levels present in the categorical variables. Many of the categorical variables have a level called 'Select' which needs to be handled because it is as good as a null value (think why?).

## Summary
The lead scoring case study employed a logistic regression model to address specific business requirements, revealing valuable insights into lead conversion dynamics. Despite a substantial influx of leads, only a minority transition into paying customers, with a significant portion originating from India, particularly concentrated in Mumbai. There were columns which were high imbalanced, so we have dropped columns which are Search, Magazine, Newspaper Article, X Education Forums, Newspaper, Digital Advertisement, Through Recommendations, Receive More Updates About Our Courses, Update me on Supply Chain Content, Get updates on DM Content, and I agree to pay the amount through cheque. Also, we dropped columns Country, What matters most to you in choosing a course and Do Not Call since these had values were one values was dominating other values. We also found value counts for each categorical variable and understood their relation with Converted which is target variable.
To enhance data quality, columns featuring 'Select' labels necessitate mandatory selections, notably in fields like Customer Occupation and Specialization. Leads with higher engagement metrics, such as total visits and time spent on the platform, exhibit greater potential for conversion. We used RFE to get top 15 important feature to build our model. Using these features, we build logistic Regression models. Finally, we using 12 features, we build model and tested model with test data. We found accuracy, pression, recall for train and test models. It provided good results and model was not overfitting. Notably, many leads pursue courses for improved career prospects, predominantly specializing in Finance Management, with HR, Finance, and Marketing Management being high-probability conversion areas. Leveraging improved customer engagement tactics, particularly through email and call interactions, can significantly enhance conversion rates, especially among leads displaying activity like email opens. Additionally, implementing SMS communication could further bolster conversion efforts. Given the prevalence of unemployed leads, prioritizing engagement strategies tailored to this demographic emerges as a key focus for maximizing conversion potential.
